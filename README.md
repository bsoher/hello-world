# hello-world
Just my first repository on git

Not much to say. Got a Ph.D. and now am trying to stay employed. I take MRI images and general data and find better ways to process and view them.

At the end of the day, I commit my changes on SVN.  But, I'm open to trying out git.

'Nuff said.

Brian.
